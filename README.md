# flipper-resource-monorepo

This mono repo is a collection of useful resources that I have gathered from several sources. Instead of linking to github projects like most of the repos I decided to create one repo that automatically downloads all the repos that I frequently use. Inspiration for this project was this collection of resources: Collection of resources: https://github.com/djsime1/awesome-flipperzero
